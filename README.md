My second task as intern in PRODIGY INFOTECH.

Task about:
Delope a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathrmatical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt image.

In this task we have to encrypt and decrypt an image using the location path of the image of the input and save the encrypted or decrypted image at the save location with encrypted or decrypted tage as the image.

**Image encryption**

Encrypts an image by altering it's image pixel values through various operations by taking image path as input from user and save the encrypted image with tage line "encrypted" at the end of image name.

**Image decryption**

Reverse the ecnrypted image to it's original image form and svae the decrypted as "decrypted" tage line to image name.

This process involves **Swapping of Pixel Values:**

This method involves swapping the values of pixel based on a predefined pattern or algorithm. Example, Swap the value of adjacent pixel or pixel at specific interval by using mathamical operations
